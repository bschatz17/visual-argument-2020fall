I completely changed my idea from my original proposal. Now, my project is focused around drinking water. More specifically, it will visualize exactly what a gallon a day looks like.
I believe that simply drinking water is a great cure to most colds/headaches/sluggishness problems etc. I make it a goal of my own to drink bottles of water every day so I can stay alert and awake.
So far, through gimp, I have placed a background and a few other layers. I am going to stack up all the different forms of drinking water to display what they look like in gallon form. 
For example, a nalgene water bottle and a plastic waterbottle with both be shown. GIMP is very tedious and I am learning everthing through this project.
